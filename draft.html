    <p>
      When authoring a site, developers often use script resources that their users most probably already downloaded.
      Popular frameworks, libraries and polyfills are used across many sites.
      Yet in many cases, the code for these libraries has to be downloaded over and over for every site the end use goes to.
      </p>
    <p>
      There are multiple reasons for that:
      <ul>
          <li>Caches directives do not oblige the browser to cache resources, and it evicts popular resources when disk space becomes limited (YW:
          I'm not sure this is the case (Need data). If it is, the place to fix this is in caches, not by bypassing them. )</li>
          <li>Resources are often fetched by different sites from various URLs, making it impossible for browser caches to share them among
          sites </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        If developers could guaranty with high probability that their favorite framework will be cached a usable at the user's cache, it
        could influence their decision whether to use it or not, since the performance impact of their decision would be entirely different.
    <p>One traditional solution to this problem has been CDNs.  CDNs help accomplish a few things:</p> 
      <ol>
        <li>Offloading a small amount of traffic off your own network<li>
        <li>Requests are fulfilled regionally, requiring less hops</li>
      </ol>
    <p>
      Besides these roles, CDNs in the context of JS frameworks, also help to unify the URL with which popular frameworks are served across
    sites, enabling keeping them as a single resource in the browser's cache and serving them to multiple sites.
    With multiple sites accessing this single URL, the browser cache can learn about its popularity and avoid evicting it.
    CDNs also make sure that the resource cache directives are approporiate - 
      this is important as not all Web authors have the skills or permissions to configure cache directives on the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the CDN approach have <a href="http://statichtml.com/2011/google-ajax-libraries-caching.html">failed</a>. Multiple CDNs for
    the same high-profile frameworks, along with large version number fragmentation have led to very low cross-site code reuse rates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Increasingly the Web requires more imperative script, as we Extend the Web Forward, this will continue to increase.
        We can also expect the amount of polyfills, used across multiple sites, to increase.

    	As we layer things atop one another, there are only two choices: 
        1) a pre-build which <em>redelivers those shared modules in a single request</em> or <em>deal with dependency management at runtime</em>.  
        The later is particularly slow and unattractive.
        (???YW: I don't understand what you're saying here)
    </p>
    <p>
    	This proposal lays out an idea for a special kind of store, "closer to the metal" with less of the problems that the current model creates.  
        It aims to make performance and management considerably easier.

      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>Script Store</strong> is a persistent data store (a reposotitory) that lives on a user's machine, outside of traditional cache and exposes a context through with which any page (which we will refer to as a <strong>Script Store Client</strong>) can communicate with it via async message passing regarding scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
      	A <strong>Script Store Client</strong> page itself <em>uses</em> one or more stores as a client by means of either declarative or imperative interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
      	We introduce the concept of a <strong>Default Script Store</strong> which could potentialy be provided natively by browsers vendors themselves, as well as <strong>Named Script Stores</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
      	<strong>Script Stores</strong> are backed by a page themselves defining how they work.  Stores may pre-emptively load script resources from remote locations to prime.  Stores may manage their storage in some caching terms in the event that they are full, but as a separate and dedicated entity, this is much easier to manage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Script Stores</strong> are prototypal in nature and can extend one another, thereby helping to alleviate the "single source of truth" problem and they advertise their offerings so it is fast and painless to walk the chain to find out where something could be loaded from.

      <h2>Declarative Importing of Script Stores</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>Script Store</strong> is a persistent data store (a reposotitory) that lives on a user's machine, outside of traditional cache and communicates with pages via async message passing regarding scripts. 
      </p>

      <p>
      	The prototypal, default store has no name and can be imported as... 
	  <pre class="example">
&lt;!-- import the default script store --&gt;
&lt;link rel="import" type="application/script-store"&gt; 
	  </pre>
      </p>

      <p>
      	You can also use named script stores (and default is a valid name which would override the default).  If the default script store is present, this store extends that one (meaning that the named store will not store things that already exist in the default store)....
	  	<pre class="example">
&lt;!-- import a named script store, url backed --&gt;
&lt;link rel="import" 
      type="application/script-store"&gt; 
      id="myOrgsScriptStore"
      href="http://bkardell.github.io/tap/repository.html"&gt; 
  		</pre>
     </p>

     <p>
        And named script stores can extend other named stores...
        <pre class="example">
 &lt;!-- import a named script store, extending another --&gt;
&lt;link rel="import" 
      type="application/script-store"&gt; 
      id="myFriendsScriptStore"
      href="http://wycats.github.io/tap/repository.html"&gt; 

	  </pre>
	</section>
    <section>
      <h2>Declarative Use of Scripts from Stores</h2>

      <p>
      	You can ask that a script be loaded from the default <strong>Script Store</strong> by providing a package and version.  Leaving off the version could get you the latest one.
      	Store requests are automatically async.
      
	    <pre class="example">
&lt;script package="jquery" version="1.10.2"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
	    </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
      	Or you can ask that a script be loaded from a named store or its prototypes...
	    <pre class="example">	
&lt;script package="jquery" version="1.10.2" from="myFriendsScriptStore"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
	    </pre>
	   </p>
      <p>
      	A page can ask that a script be pre-loaded but not executed until referenced later...
	    <pre class="example">	
&lt;script package="something" preload version="1.0.0" from="myScriptStore"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
	    </pre>
	   </p>
	   <p>
      	And scripts can express dependencies based on ids....
	    <pre class="example">	
&lt;script package="jquery" id="base" version="1.10.2" from="myScriptStore"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
&lt;script dependencies="base"&gt;
    $.ready(function(){
        ....
    });
&lt;/script&gt;

	    </pre>
	   </p>

    </section>


    <section>
      <h2>Imperative Use of Scripts from Stores</h2>

      <p>
      	You can ask that scripts be loaded from the default <strong>Script Store</strong> by providing a package and version, it is async using Promises. 
      
	    <pre class="example">
ScriptStores.get("default", {package: "jquery", version: "1.10.2"}).then(function(){
    // jquery is all loaded..
});
        </pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        You can check if a script exists in a store, again, async
      
      <pre class="example">
ScriptStores.has("default", {package: "jquery", version: "1.10.2"}).then(function(result){
    // result is true or false... do something
});
        </pre>
      </p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h2>Creating a Script Stores</h2>

      <p>
        Any page can act as a script store by advertising what they contain and who they are willing to service
      
      <pre class="example">
var offerings = [{
   "package": "jquery"
   "version": "1.10.2",
   "url": "libs/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"  
}];

// Services anyone - standard domain matching ala window.postMessage()
ScriptStore.service(offerings, "*");
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      They can also use imperative means to manage the store.
      For example, pre-populate missing entries every N ms lazily every 15 seconds.
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
function lazyLoad(){
  var next = offerings.shift();
  if (next) {
    if(ScriptStore.has(next)){
      lazyLoad();
    } else {
      setTimeout(
        function () {
          ScriptStore.load({"url": next, execute: false}).then(function() {
            lazyLoad();
          });
        },
        15000
      )
  }
  } else {
    // console.log("repo all loaded...");
  }
}

lazyLoad();


        </pre>
      </p>
