				<h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>tap.js is a small (crazy proof-of-concept) JavaScript library which loads/stores script into special universal cross-domain "repositories" thereby allowing us to mark "special" scripts and not just place them on a CDN, but store them in a special place,  "closer to the metal", avoid HTTP requests for them altogether, and prevent them from being easily wiped out as they are in common caches.</p>

<h3>How is this related to basket.js?</h3>

<p>Great question, I'm glad you asked.  Actually, it extends Addy Osmani's <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/basket.js">basket.js</a> (which was in turn created as a response to a tweeted suggestion by Steve Souders).  They have a cool and informative site - if the localStorage bit seems unusual, give it a read.</p>





<h3>How does it work?</h3>


<p>Your client loads <strong>tap.js</strong> - it's fairly small, do it however you like.  </p>

<p>It loads up an iframe to a <strong>repository</strong> - just an html compiled with JavaScript inline (with decent cache advice, this should be less than the cost of a normal script include for any one library). It builds on a few layers, promises and a message client relay to allow simpler communication sugar through postmessage/message channel which is in turn build on promises (via <strong>RSVP</strong>) and all of this uses <strong>basket.js</strong> as a special <strong>localStorage</strong> based cache which is not subject to the same frequent expulsions and misses as standard browser cache.  </p>

<p><strong>Once populated, no website using that repo should have to ask for it again</strong>.</p>

<p>Repos can be populated as requested and can lazily prime common libraries to further decrease the likelihood a download will ever be made. </p>







<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<p>We support browsers which support basket.js.  basket.js supports locally caching scripts in any browser with <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=localstorage">localStorage capabilities</a>.</p>

<h2>Client Usage</h2>




<p>Declaratively let your page know that you are using a repo via a meta tag:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"tap-repository"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">"http://bkardell.github.io/tap/repository.html"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>...and which files should be loaded from said repository:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">&lt;!-- in the head, as per normal --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">data-tap-get=</span><span class="s">"hitch-0.6.3-min.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">data-tap-get=</span><span class="s">"jquery-1.10.2.min.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Include <strong>tap.js</strong> ...</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">&lt;!-- This has to go *after* your tags above... --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"application/javascript"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"http://bkardell.github.io/tap/dist/tap.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Wanna know when scripts are ready?</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
    <span class="nx">tap</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ready</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(){</span>
        <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"test"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> 
            <span class="s2">"All my files loaded... Anyone using this repo shouldnt have to fetch again..."</span>
            <span class="s2">"\nhitch: "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">Hitch</span>
            <span class="s2">"\nJQuery: "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>.... <strong>That's it.</strong> </p>



<p>To free space basket.js will only remove cached scripts that it placed in localStorage itself. The data stored by other code in same origin will not be touched.</p>

<h2>Can I create a Repo?</h2>


<p>Duh.  Of course.  Pull down <a href="http://bkardell.github.io/tap">http://bkardell.github.io/tap</a>, place some files in the <strong>/libs</strong> folder.  Then run one of the following..</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// creates a repository which loads files from your /libs folder on demand...</span>
<span class="nx">node</span> <span class="nx">create</span>

<span class="c1">// make it lazily loads things that aren't already stored/requested (1 file every 15 seconds)...</span>
<span class="nx">node</span> <span class="nx">create</span> <span class="nx">lazy</span>

<span class="c1">// tweak the lazy timing in ms (1 file every minute).</span>
<span class="nx">node</span> <span class="nx">create</span> <span class="nx">lazy</span> <span class="mi">60000</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you ever add files to your repo, just re-run the create script.</p>

<p>Upload <strong>repository.html</strong> and <strong>/libs</strong> somewhere.</p>

<p>.... <strong>That's it.</strong> </p>
